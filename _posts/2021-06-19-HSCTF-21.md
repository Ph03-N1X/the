## Challenge : NRC

### Description:

![NRC](/assets/img/HSCTF21/nrc.png)

On viewing the webpage, **right click** is disabled to check the source code. So I used keyboard shortcut **CTRL+U** to view the source code. Checking the `useless-file.css` file gave the flag.

**<em>Flag: `flag{keyboard_shortcuts_or_taskbar}`</em>**

## Challenge : mesmessage-board

### Description:

![msgboard](/assets/img/HSCTF21/messageboard.png)

In description, we are provided with login credentials to the site. Logging in we get the following page. 

![msgboard1](/assets/img/HSCTF21/msgboard1.png)

I checked if there was any cookie authentication and I got the cookie with name `userData` and value `j%3A%7B%22userID%22%3A%22972%22%2C%22username%22%3A%22kupatergent%22%7D`. Decoding the cookie value using **URL Decoder** I got <br>
`j:{"userID":"972","username":"kupatergent"}` <br>
We are given the source code of site. Going through the `app.js`, there's a cookie value which checks admin userID and admin username. I got the admin username to be **admin** from source code. Now we have the admin username but don't know the userID of admin. As the userID of kupatergent is 972, I thought of bruteforcing the **userID** of admin using burpsuite. From bruteforcing we find the userID of admin to be **768**. Setting the cookie value as `j%3A%7B%22userID%22%3A%22768%22%2C%22username%22%3A%22admin%22%7D`, we get the flag.

**<em>Flag: `flag{y4m_y4m_c00k13s}`</em>**

## Challenge : digits-of-pi

### Description:

![pi](/assets/img/HSCTF21/pi.png)

We are given an Excel spreadsheet. Almost every option is disabled in it. Checking all the menu options, I figured that there's a hidden sheet and I wasn't able to view it. 

![pi](/assets/img/HSCTF21/pihidden.png)

In Edit menu there's **Find and replace** option is enabled. So I used it and searched for flag and we get the flag in the hidden sheet.

![piflag](/assets/img/HSCTF21/piflag.png)

**<em>Flag: `flag{hidden_sheets_are_not_actually_hidden}`</em>**

## Challenge : digits-of-pi-2           

### Description:

![pi2](/assets/img/HSCTF21/pi2.png)

This challenge is also related to an Excel spreadsheet but in this there isn't any hidden sheets. Instead it's getting data from a private excel sheet and viewing only some data from it. When we select the **A2** cell we can observe that. The id of private excel sheet is **1MD4O3pFoQY59_YoW_ZzxRUg-rBgHFlAaYxnNABmqc3A**. <br>

![pi2id](/assets/img/HSCTF21/pi2id.png)

As it's fetching the data from different spreadsheet, I thought of checking the network traffic. In the response of `fetchData` request, we find the leet string without flag format.

**<em>Flag: `flag{m4k3_sur3_t0_r3str1ct_y0ur_imp0rtr4ng3s}`</em>**

## Challenge : grading           

### Description:

![grading](/assets/img/HSCTF21/grading.png)

After logging into the site, we can see there are two tests **simple quiz** and **another simple quiz**. Answering the simple quiz isn't possible as the deadline is passed and for second quiz we can answer it. Checking the source code of **app.js**, we find that we can modify the submission of **simple quiz** using questionID.

```js
.post(authMW, (req, res) => {
    const now = Date.now()
    const form = req.user.forms.id(req.params.formID)
    if(now > form.deadline) {
        res.json({response: "too late"})
    } else {
        if(req.body.ID) {
            const question = req.user.questions.id(req.body.ID)
            console.log(question);
            question.submission = req.body.value
            req.user.save()
        } else {
            form.submitted = true
            req.user.save()
        }

        res.json({response: "heh"})
    }

}) 
```

We can find the answer `Africa is not a country` to the simple quiz from the source code. So we need to bypass the deadline check in order to pass the quiz and get the flag. We use use a **CURL** request to modify this. <br>

`curl -X POST https://grading.hsc.tf/60ce266c8c156e7884529a1a -d "ID=60ce266c8c156eca01529a18&value=Africa is not a country" --cookie  "connect.sid=s%3Ar_VRsm87IlVv00l6n9BJmnJUYClRsLKL.9%2Bhx5iliwLc41q8F1LVqCExl%2Bweaxspj2dO9wJ8Bh3k"`

**<em>Flag: `flag{th3_an5w3r_w4s_HSCTF_0bvi0us1y}`</em>**

## Challenge : big-blind           

### Description:

![bigblind](/assets/img/HSCTF21/blind.png)

From the challenge name I thought the challenge is related to **Blind SQL injection**. So I tried some basic SQLi login bypass which lead to **Internal Server Error**. As the challenge says it's blind, I thought of using `sleep` function to check the **time based sqli** and there was a delay in the request. We need to dump the MySQL database to retrieve the flag. We can use a python script to bruteforce the password field or use **Sqlmap** to dump the complete database. Execute the sqlmap using the below command to dump the database.<br>

`sqlmap -u https://big-blind.hsc.tf/ --forms --dump`

**<em>Flag: `flag{any_info_is_good_info}`</em>**
